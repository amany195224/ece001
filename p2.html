    <td>This type of operating system does not interact with the computer directly. There is an operator which takes similar
       jobs having same requirement and group them into batches.
       It is the responsibility of operator to sort the jobs with similar needs.</td>
    <td>Each task is given some time to execute, so that all the tasks work smoothly. Each user gets time of CPU as they use single system. 
      These systems are also known as Multitasking Systems. The task can be from single user or from different users also.
       The time that each task gets to execute is called quantum. After this time interval is over OS switches over to next task.</td>
    <td>These systems run on a server and provide the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions.
       These type of operating systems allow shared access of files, printers, security, applications, and other networking functions over a small private network.
        One more important aspect of Network Operating Systems is that all the users are well aware of the underlying configuration,
       of all other users within the network, their individual connections etc. and thatâ€™s why these computers are popularly known as tightly coupled systems.</td>
